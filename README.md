Final goal of the LunchBunch App is for users to be able to join a workplace "common kitchen".

In the first phase of the project, user can enter a search keyword (for example: pasta or chicken) and 10 recipes will be generated dynamically. When the user clicks on one of the recipes, they can view the nutrient information about the recipe in a FDA style food label.

Used NPM to install the nutritionix food label generating plugin
