Lunch Bunch App will be designed for users willing to participate in workspace lunch sharing.
It will have the functionality for users to join a workplace "common kitchen".
Users can enter a search word and filter their dietary preferences. Each day of the week, individual user will be required to cook for the team based on the dietary preferences of the participants in the "common kitchen".
